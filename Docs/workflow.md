# Problem Solving Workflow

This document outlines a structured approach to solving LeetCode problems efficiently and learning systematically.

---

## 1️⃣ Understand the Problem
- Read the problem carefully, including constraints and examples.
- Identify **inputs**, **outputs**, and **edge cases**.
- Highlight important details such as array size limits or special cases.
- Example: If array length <= 10^5, O(n^2) solutions might be too slow.

- [LeetCode Problem Guide](https://leetcode.com/explore/)
- [GeeksforGeeks Problem Understanding](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/)

---

## 2️⃣ Plan Your Approach
- Start with a **brute-force solution** to understand the problem.
- Identify possible optimizations (hash maps, two pointers, sliding window, recursion, DP).
- Consider multiple approaches and select the one with optimal **time & space complexity**.
- Draw diagrams or examples to visualize algorithms.

**Tips:**
- Think about corner cases.
- Write pseudocode before coding.
- Use whiteboard or paper if needed.

- [Striver’s SDE Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-sde-sheet/)

---

## 3️⃣ Write Clean Code
- Use meaningful variable names.
- Add **docstrings** with problem ID, title, link, difficulty, topics, and description.
- Modularize code into functions for readability.
- Include comments for non-obvious logic.

**Example Docstring:**
```python
"""
LeetCode 1. Two Sum
https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/
Difficulty: Easy
Topics: Array, Hash Map
"""
