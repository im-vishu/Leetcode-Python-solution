# Problem Solving Workflow

This document explains the recommended approach for solving LeetCode problems efficiently.

## Steps:

1. **Understand the Problem**
   - Read the problem statement carefully.
   - Identify inputs, outputs, and constraints.

2. **Plan Your Approach**
   - Consider brute-force solutions first.
   - Analyze possible optimizations (hash maps, two pointers, DP, etc.)

3. **Write Code**
   - Use a clean and readable structure.
   - Add docstrings with problem ID, title, link, difficulty, and topics.

4. **Test Your Solution**
   - Run sample test cases.
   - Use pytest to validate correctness.

5. **Analyze Complexity**
   - Evaluate time and space complexity.
   - Check if further optimization is possible.

6. **Submit & Document**
   - Commit solution file to the correct folder.
   - Add tutorial or explanation if needed.
