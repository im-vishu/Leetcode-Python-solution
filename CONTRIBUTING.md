3. **Add a New Problem Solution**

   * Place your Python solution inside the `solutions/` folder.
   * Follow the naming convention: `0001_two_sum.py`.
   * Include a **docstring** at the top of the file with:

     Description: <Brief 1-3 line problem description>
     """
     ```

4. **Add Tests (Optional)**

   * Add a test file in the `tests/` folder named `test_<problem-id>_<problem-name>.py`.
   * Use `pytest` to test your solution:

     ```python
     from solutions.<solution-file> import Solution

     def test_example():
         assert Solution().<method>() == <expected>
     ```

5. **Update README Table**

   * Run the auto-generate script to update the problem table:

   ```bash
   python tools/generate_readme_table.py
   ```

6. **Commit and Push Changes**

   ```bash
   ```

git add .
git commit -m "Add solution for <Problem ID> <Problem Name>"
git push origin feature/<problem-id>-<problem-name>

```
